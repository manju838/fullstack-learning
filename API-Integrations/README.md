## API-Integration:

API's are used to connect a app to an external service. For example, a web application created using React and javascript take in an image and can call upon a computer vision service to return do object recognition. This computer vision service might be coded in python and is confidential to the service provider. Thus it is called as an API to do the process in the backend (thus being secure) and return the result to the frontend webapp to be displayed on the web.

FastAPI is once of the most popular API library for this task as it is very fast in comparison to other implementations (Flask, Django etc.) and is also asynchronous. This section mainly deals with using fast API.
