HTTP Verbs:

All the messages on the internet are sent using HTTP/HTTPS requests. This follows a client server model where the client asks for a specific request and the server sends a response for that request.

These HTTP request methods are called HTTP verbs and the below are some of the main ones (corresponding to CRUD operations):

* POST Request: Request to modify underlying data.                                  [Create Operation]  **C**
                * Create **new** resources and allot them if needed.            

* GET Request: Simple requests to get information.                                  [Read Operation]    **R**             
                * Only retrieve information.                                    
                * Cant modify data.

* PUT Request: Request to modify underlying data.                                   [Update Operation]  **U**
                * Update the existing resources that are already allotted.

* Delete Request: Delete the data from the server.                                  [Delete Operation]  **D**
                * Remove existing data
