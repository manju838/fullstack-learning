## 3. Working with YAML/YML files:
Status: Completed

This is an introductory course on YAML files done based on <www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA90BTozdow&t=26s>. YAML files are the basics of any automation of code we do to make it production ready, be it in Docker, Kubernetes or even pulling, building and then deploying code on AWS EC2 instance for production.

### Learnings:

Markup Language is a text-encoding system which specifies the structure and formatting of a document and potentially the relationship between its parts.(wikipedia).
HTML has a head and body tags and we have some div tags inside it and some href tags inside divs and so on, it is like a tree with parent child relationship.

YAML originally was Yet Another Markup Language but now it is used to represent objects as a file, in other words serialised objects are represented as a YAML file. Data Serialisation languages do this task (YAML, JSON, XML, etc).
Converting object into YAML/JSON is Serialisation and viceversa is DeSerialisation.

Check out theory notes about YAML at <github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DevOps-Bootcamp/tree/main/YAML>

JSON, XML are also briefly described in the video tutorial but these are syntax based and GPT/ Google search can help figure stuff out fast.
