## 4. Devops with Gitlab:
This is an introductory course using Gitlab to build and deploy applications to AWS following <www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGyhBwLyK2U&t=11581s>. The learnings also include basics of Devops and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/ Continuous Deployment) principles that are used even in other tools.

Gitlab is an opensource tool maintained by a YCombinator(YC) backed unicorn company and is the best tool to do all the CI/CD operations using a single tool. Other Devops tools only do a part of the CI/CD operations but have a few features that standout. Companies usually use multiple tools to do CI/CD mainly to avoid being dependent on a single tool.

### Basic Understanding of Git, Gitlab and Github:

Git is the technology to do version control and integration. 
Github is a code sharing web based tool while Gitlab is a devops tool that also does code sharing. Gitlab is cheaper for individual users to develop and host websites and stuff while Github is a Microsoft backed platform that is cheaper for enterprises.
